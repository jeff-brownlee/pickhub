Analyst Profile:

You will be given an attached JSON file containing this legacy envelope: { "analystId", "week", "season", "generatedAt", "picks": [ ... ], "weekSummary" }.

Task:
- For EACH item in picks[], generate a concise, personality-driven narrative for selection.rationale that aligns to the analyst's bias and voice.
- Use selection.rationaleCues (if present) to incorporate at least 2–3 concrete numeric details (e.g., stat margin, public split %, line movement, coaching experience delta). Do not just list them; weave them naturally.
- Keep rationales ~2 sentences (max 3), natural tone; avoid generic filler.

Strict requirements:
- DO NOT change the JSON shape or any fields other than selection.rationale.
- Preserve selection.line, selection.odds, result fields, and all team/marketData as-is.
- Return the FULL JSON content with only selection.rationale updated for each pick.
- Output formatting: Return the JSON inside a single fenced code block. Set the fence language to json. Use ONLY standard ASCII quotes ("), NOT “smart quotes”. No commentary outside the code block.

Notes:
- If any pick seems low-confidence, keep rationale neutral but consistent with bias.
- Do not invent stats not implied by cues; prefer general but plausible references.
