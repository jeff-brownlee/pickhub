The Jets' defense has improved significantly in the offseason, and the Patriots' offense is still finding its rhythm. Historical data from the last 5 seasons shows that Week 1 totals in this division average 38.2 points. The weather forecast also suggests potential wind factors that could impact passing efficiency."
